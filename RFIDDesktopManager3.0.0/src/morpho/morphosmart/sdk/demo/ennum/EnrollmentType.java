 * Specifies the number of fingerprint image acquisitions. Allowed values are 0, 1 and 3.
 * We strongly recommend setting this value to 0 (default value) or 3 for enrollment purpose to increase the system performances: in this case, the template is generated from a consolidation calculation of three consecutive acquisitions of the same fingerprint.
 * It is also possible to set this value to 1 for verification purpose. In this case, it is not possible to save the record in the internal database: in this case, the template is generated from one single fingerprint acquisition.
 * On MorphoSmartâ„¢ FINGER VP, the value 1 is deprecated.
